As of 2017-01-06, the internal and external OpenSL ES
registries have been moved to a public Github repository at

    https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenSL-ES-Registry

The Khronos registry website now pulls content from this repository to
create its backing store, and changes to the registry must be proposed
as pull requests against the github repository.

This portion of Subversion is being locked down to protect against
future changes, and is officially obsolete.
